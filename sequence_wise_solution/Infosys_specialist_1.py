''''Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in
the gym. Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.
You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have
to perform such that you become tired. Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as
others also have to use the machines.
If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.'''

'''

E :: INTEGER
The first line contains an integer, E, denoting the Energy.
E :: 1 -> 10^5
N :: INTEGER
The next line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of exercises.
N :: 1 -> 10^5
A :: INTEGER ARRAY
Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < N) contains an integer describing the amount of
energy drained by i-th exercise.
